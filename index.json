[{"body":"We'll be in touch ‚ù§Ô∏è\nDon\u0026#39;t wander too far... ","link":"https://example.com/docs/documentation/","section":"docs","title":"Documentation"},{"body":"Version changelog v1.4.2:\nAdded new animation key (Hue, Saturation \u0026amp; Value, or HSV) for layer nodes, folder support is not ready but can be opted into. Special thanks to Gambot for making this feature possible by writing the shader for it and helping with other OpenGL issues. Added a new settings tab called \u0026quot;Animation keys\u0026quot;, where you can change your preferences. At the moment there are three settings to modify the new HSV keys' behaviour. Added new \u0026quot;Reset recent files list\u0026quot; button to the settings. The timeline will now automatically stop when it reaches its final frame and it's not looping. Reworked most of the text to (hopefully) be easier to understand. Adjusted the Japanese translation to match with the previous change. Allowed keybinds to be repeated (with a delay of 125ms) Association handling, this means that you can double click your .anie projects, and set AnimeEffects as the program to open them with. Fixed optimized palette exporting Added a warning when exporting with odd height or width values, as that may break the rendering pipeline. Added a \u0026quot;Check for Updates\u0026quot; button in the \u0026quot;Help\u0026quot; menu. Added an optional filewatcher in the resource window, you now may watch for changes to your image files and automatically reload them within the project when a change is detected. Simplified resource addition by just having an \u0026quot;Add resources\u0026quot; button instead of a menu Added option to change FPS playback speed within the \u0026quot;Project\u0026quot; menu, this is saved on the project itself. Changed \u0026quot;Open Recents\u0026quot; to read from QSettings instead of a file. Added support for importing .webp and .tiff images Tiff images gets imported as a single layer, no layered support is currently available. Fixed all known bugs with the \u0026quot;breeze_dark\u0026quot; theme Fixed all GitHub actions Added nightly artifacts to all actions. BREAKING CHANGE: Bumped Project version from 0.5 to 0.6, this makes it so you cannot load projects made with this new version on older versions of AnimeEffects. Download here v1.4.0:\nA new dark theme has been added (breeze_dark) A lot of new scripts for building and deploying have been made Version bump from 1.3.5 to 1.4.0 Added keybindings for Timeline movement (Ctrl + Left or Right arrow keys) Jumping to the first or last frame (Ctrl + Up or Down arrow keys) Toggle Looping (Ctrl + R) Toggle playback (Ctrl + Spacebar) Toggle docks (Ctrl + Q) Fix pull bones feature (thanks to aoi for reporting and Larpon for the help diagnosing) Fix FFMPEG exporting, so now you can export to every available format file! (Please don't have '%20' in your file name to ensure this works properly) Reduced minimum OpenGL version from 4.0 to 3.3 Fix MathUtil (this fixed the pull bones feature, along with other things that I may have failed to notice) When opening a recent file, if it is not found it will be automatically deleted from the record (changes will apply on your next restart) Upgrade Linux CI to Ubuntu 20.04 Jammy, a compatibility version for older distros has been made available. Fixed MacOS CI, a zip containing AnimeEffects.app has been made available.

AnimeEffects was originally developed by Japanese artist and programmer Hidefuku, the app during its development gained a lot of traction for being an easy and open source way to do 2D animation, unfortunately however in April 2017 Hidefuku would make his last known commit to the repository, after which they completely vanished from the internet.\nIn 2019 a group of artists and developers picked up this project to bring further improvements to it and to hopefully keep this amazing project alive, and here we are now!\nHere are the people that have helped this project in one way or another.
